        <h3>Angela's Awesome Enchiladas</h3>
        <p>The secret to these awesome chicken enchiladas is in the seasonings! I whipped these up on my own using ingredients I had on hand. Shredding the chicken is the most time-consuming step, but it's worth it in the end. Serve with sour cream and a side of Spanish rice. Give these babies a try!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into chunks</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups sour cream</li>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two forks.</li>
                <li>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
                <li>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
